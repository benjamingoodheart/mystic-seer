# Mystic Seer

## About
Inspired by the incredible episode of *The Twilight Zone* entitled ["The Nick Of Time"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nick_of_Time_(The_Twilight_Zone)), I decided to recreate the fortune telling napkin dispenser as a way to learn more about Rust.

I reimagined the seer as a Command Line Interface program. The concept is simple: ask the seer a yes or no question, and it will provide you with an answer. 

## Installation

If you do not already have rust and cargo installed on your machine, first follow the directions as detailed [here](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/getting-started/installation.html).

Then clone the repo and navigate into the root of the project.

``` 
git clone https://github.com/benjamingoodheart/mystic-seer 
cd mystic-seer
```

## Run the Program

In the `mystic-seer` root directory run the following command:

```
cargo run --quiet
```

You will see the following prompt:

```
>> Welcome to the Busy Bee Cafe. The mystic seer beckons...
>> Put in a penny? Y/N 
>>  
```

Enjoy! Don't get too stuck, and come back real soon!
